# Guide to the Breville Bambino and Bambino Plus

This guide primarily focuses on the ThermoJet line of machines from Breville that don't inlclude an inbuilt grinder. Much of the content can be applied to the Breville Barrista Pro however.

## Popular/Recommended Accesories

### Tamper
The tamper that comes in the box isn't particularly ergonomic or consitent to use. It is definitely recommended to upgrade the tamper.
- Self Levelling Tamper: These tampers feature a levelling plate that sits on top of the basket and then during tamping a spring is depressed to tamp the coffee grounds up to a certain force dictated by the spring rating. This helps to achieve tamping consistency in terms of force applied and a level tamp across the entire puck.
  - [Normcore 53.3mm tamper](https://www.normcorewares.com/collections/coffee-tamper/products/normcore-spring-loaded-tamper-upgrate-v4?variant=40267140104388) - Very popular option across any espresso machine and generally pretty good bang for the buck.
- Precision: These tampers aim to be as wide as possible to ensure that the edge of the basket is also tamped well. Also the precise width helps to ensure a level tamp as there is little give to allow an off angle tamp. These are not recommended if you are using the stock baksets that come with the machine as they taper inwards and prevent a full tamp. These options generally come at a premium.

## Portafilters
The standard portafilter that comes with the Bambino and Bambino Plus primarly is designed around the use of Dual wall baskets. Using a bottomless portafilter can be useful when using single wall baskets to daignose extraction issues. Also there are other options for dual spouted portafilters that are a bit better at splitting shots when using a single wall basket.

- Dual Spout Portafilter: the stock basket can be used to split shots across two cups but the following options do it better.
  - [Breville Portafilter Kit 54mm](https://www.breville.com/us/en/parts-accessories/parts/sp0027237.html): This is the portafilter that comes in the box with the Breville Barrista Express, Barrista Touch, Barrista Pro, Infuser and Duo Temp Pro. Generally it feels more premium and splits shots better than the stock Bambino portafilter. If using IMS baskets you may need to remove the black plastic insert so that it can fit.
  - [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20220315000754&origin=y&SearchText=double+mouth+portafilter+54mm): More affordable option however the quality and longevity is unknown.
  - [Pesado Dual Spout](https://pesado.com.au/collections/portafilter/products/spouted-portafilter-full-pom?variant=41480019476651): Will fit both sizes of IMS baskets without modification.
- IMS Basket 14 - 18 grams or 18 - 22 grams sizes. These baskets are currently the only precision baskets available that are compatible with any 54mm Breville machine. Note that these baksets may be too deep to use with the stock Bambino portafilter, the 14 - 18 gram can fit if the black plastic insert is removed from the portafilter.
